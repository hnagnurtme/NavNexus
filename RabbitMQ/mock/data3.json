We consider a scenario where a UAV serves as an aerial base station to provide computation offloading opportunities for ground users. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem aiming to minimize the total energy consumption of both the UAV and users while satisfying the computation latency constraints. To solve this challenging problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that can make real-time decisions on computation offloading, resource allocation, and UAV trajectory planning. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the total energy consumption by up to 35% compared to baseline schemes.",
